<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, we observed two more interstellar comets. The first confirmed interstellar comet we observedand studied in such detail, there were two other known objects- 1I/Oumuamua (2017)and 2I/Borisov (2019), which also entered our Solar System from outside and showed that interstellar objects are not so rare. After them came 3I/ATLAS (2025), which surprised astronomers because it was not as visible from afar and its activity was delayed compared to typical comets.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1I/Oumuamua</strong> is the first confirmed interstellar object to pass through the Solar System. Discovered on <strong>October 19, 2017</strong>, by the Pan-STARRS telescope, it was approximately 33 million kilometers from Earth at the time of its closest approach to the Sun on <strong>September 9, 2017</strong>. The object is estimated to be between 100 and 1000 meters long and has a red color, similar to object in the outer Solar System. Despite its close approach to the Sun, it showed no signs of a comet`s coma and exhibited non-gravitational acceleration, leading astronomers to conclude that it is likely of <strong>extrasolar origin</strong>.</p>

<div class= "right">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2I/Borisov</strong>, originally designated <strong>C/2019 Q4 (Borisov)</strong>, is the first observed rogue comet and the second observed interstellar interloper, after 1I/Oumuamua. It was discovered by the Crimean amateur astronomer and telescope maker Gennadiy Borisov on <strong>29 August 2019</strong> UTC (30 August local time) in MARGO Observatory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2I/Borisov</strong> has a heliocentric orbital eccentricity of 3.36 and is not bound to the Sun. The comet passed through the ecliptic of the Solar System at the end of <strong>October 2019</strong>, and made its closest approach to the Sun at just over 2 AU on <strong>8 December 2019</strong>. The comet passed closest to Earth on <strong>28 December 2019</strong>. <strong>In November 2019</strong>, astronomers from Yale University said that the comet`s tail was 14 times the size of Earth, and stated, "It`s humbling to realize how small Earth is next to this visitor from another solar system."</p>
