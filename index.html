<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than 50 years we have wanted to find life in the Universe. In 1977 2 American space probes were launched into space: Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. On board Voyager 1, scientists placed a gold record that recorded greetings in 50 languages, music, images of people, animals, airplanes and other images of Earth objects.We invited Extraterrestrial civilizations to our homes, we hoped to contact them. And perhaps right now we are witnessing contact with an extraterrestrial civilization that is thousands of years ahead of us in development.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 1, 2025 the Atlas telescope in Chile saw an interstellar comet that arrived in the Solar System. It was named after the telescope, Comet "3I/ATLAS". Its speed simply amazed scientists. No object in our Solar System is moving at 68 km/sec. Also, the trajectory of this comet is very unusual and defies any explanation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 3, 2025 comet 3I/ATLAS flew very close to Mars and according to all calculations of our scientists, it should have crashed into Mars, but not only did it fly by, it also changed its course and even the gravity of Mars could not pull it towards itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 29, 2025 comet 3I/ATLAS passed perihelion and was out of sight for a few days. The Sun did not melt it, as scientists assumed, Comet 3I/ATLAS simply changed its color.</p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the closer Comet 3I/ATLAS are to the Earth, the more urgent the question becomes: Were we right when we called other civilizations? We do not know for what purpose they fly to us. Astronomers have an expression "Dark forest", it means that all civilizations existing in the Universe try to live in such a way that no one knows about them. And perhaps this is a very correct decision, since not all developed civilizations can be friendly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, NASA has launched a Planetary defense protocol, but this is not talked about in the media and no one knows what it is and whether it will help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 19, 2025 the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the Earth. Will ants be able to resist the boot?</p>
